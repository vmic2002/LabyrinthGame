# LabyrinthGame

Labyrinth game programmed in ARMv7 assembly.

## Run it for yourself!
Head over to [here](https://ecse324.ece.mcgill.ca/simulator/?sys=arm-de1soc) to try the labyrinth game for yourself.
Copy the *labyrinthgame.asm* code into the emulator. Click *Compile and Load* then *Continue*

Make sure to click on the PS/2 keyboard at the bottom right in the picture below.

Press a number 1 through 9 to complete 1 of all 9 possible maps.

Once the map is loaded, press the arrow keys to move to the end of the map.

The game will restart and at this point the user can input another number from 1 to 9 (the game restarts forever).
